# C-Structs in Haskell

This repository is part of the development of [```Hasky```](https://github.com/pinselimo/Hasky/). It defines types for ```C``` ```struct```s in ```Haskell``` and their instance declarations as Storable.

## Usage

You can use these types as a classic ```hackage``` package. It has no other dependencies than some of the ```Foreign.*``` modules contained in the standard library of ```GHC```.

~~~haskell
λ> import Foreign.C.Structs
λ> s = Struct2 1 2 :: Struct2 Int Int
~~~

can be interpreted as an equivalent to:

~~~C
struct Struct2 {
    int s2fst;
    int s2snd;
};

struct Struct2 s;
s.s2fst = 1;
s.s2snd = 2;
~~~

or with Python's ```ctypes```:

~~~python
>>> from ctypes import Structure, c_int
>>> class Struct2( Structure ):
...     _fields_ = [("s2fst", c_int), ("s2snd", c_int)]
...
>>> s = Struct2(1,2)
~~~

On memory all of these examples should have the exact same representation. A pointer to either ```s``` can then be exchanged with the other and used in a ```foreign``` call.
For a more elaborated usage example checkout [```Hasky```](https://github.com/pinselimo/Hasky/hasky/haskell/res/HaskyTuple.hs/). It uses ```Foreign.C.Structs``` to declare its storage functions for ```Haskell``` tuples.

## Testing

[![Build](https://img.shields.io/travis/pinselimo/cstructs-in-haskell.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pinselimo/cstructs-in-haskell)

Identity properties are tested with QuickCheck to ensure that peek and poke are reversible. The result of ```sizeOf``` is dependent on the order of types. Its correctness can only be tested with HUnit. The ```alignment``` function is trivial and only tested implicitly through ```sizeOf```.
Imports from C are tested in ```CTest.hs``` and form together with the identity tests the guarantee that also exports to C are consistent.
All tests are performed for all available GHC versions through [haskell-ci](https://github.com/haskell-CI/haskell-ci) to ensure maximum compatibility.

## Contributing

Currently only structs with up to four fields are supported. If your use case demands more, feel free to contribute or raise an issue on GitHub. Due to the individuality of the ```sizeOf``` function, an implementation in Template Haskell currently doesn't seem feasible. Thus, instances have to be written one by one.
